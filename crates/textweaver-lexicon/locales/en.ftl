### textweaver's interface messages, in English.
###
### The format is Fluent (https://projectfluent.org/), in the subset that
### textweaver-lexicon reads: messages, terms, comments, variables, and
### one-line select variants. Every message the code asks for must be here;
### a test in textweaver-lexicon checks that.
###
### Write for the ear: every message is spoken as well as shown. Spell out
### symbols, keep sentences short, and end sentences with a full stop.
