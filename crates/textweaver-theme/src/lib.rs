//! Themes (ADR-0020): one palette per theme, checked for WCAG contrast, and
//! rendered for the terminal UI, the GUI, and HTML output.
//!
//! - [`Theme`] names a color for every semantic role ([`ColorRole`]: page,
//!   text, dim text, six heading levels, links, code, quotes, errors, panels)
//!   and a foreground, background, and attributes for every highlight and
//!   chrome style ([`StyleRole`]: selection, spoken word and sentence, find
//!   matches, bookmarks, notes, status bar, focus), plus the reader's
//!   highlight colors. Every highlight carries a text attribute, so no state
//!   is shown by color alone.
//! - Themes are TOML files ([`ThemeFile`]). Star's 23 palettes are built in
//!   ([`builtin`], ported by [`star`]); user themes load from the config
//!   folder's `themes/` directory ([`Registry::load_dir`]), with errors
//!   reported per file and unknown keys kept.
//! - [`check()`] measures every pair against WCAG 2.x (4.5:1 text, 7:1 in
//!   high-contrast themes, 3:1 for indicators) and reports APCA for
//!   information. Built-in themes pass; user themes are warned about, never
//!   blocked or silently changed.
//! - Renderers: [`terminal`] (truecolor, 256, 16, and no-color levels),
//!   [`css`] (custom properties with `prefers-color-scheme` pairs), and
//!   [`Theme::rgb_table`] for the GUI.
//! - [`os`] follows the system's light, dark, or high-contrast setting.
//! - [`reading`] lays the reader's `[highlight]` colours over a theme's
//!   spoken-word and spoken-sentence styles, with a contrast warning.
